Create a school project
1. Create a Student class with 4 fields (id, name and surname, class(int)
2. Create 2 constructors:
    1. First one empty
    2. Second one with 2 parameters (name and surname), id must be defined automatically for each new student

3. Create 3 methods:
    1. greeting method which is print "Hello, my name is, <name>"
    2. selectSubject method which is answer from user to input a subject name "Please input a subject name"
    and print output "Good decision, <subject> is very good.". Subject name must be taken from Enum.
    3. changeClass method which is change a class number (class number cant be less that 1 and more than 11)

4. Override toString method
5. Override equals and hashcode methods (they must compare only students' id)

Use all constructors and call all methods in main method.
Write tests for first and third methods.

Good luck!
