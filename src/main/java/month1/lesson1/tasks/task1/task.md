<ul dir="auto">
    <li>With the help of <code>java.util.Random</code> the program makes a random number in a range [0-100] and invites the player through a console to enter the name which is saved in the variable <code>name</code>.</li>
    <li>Before the beginning, show up given text on screen: <code>Let the game begin!</code>.</li>
    <li>The whole process of the game is processed in an infinite cycle.</li>
    <li>The player is invited to enter the number in the console, after which the program compares the hidden number with the fact that the user has entered.</li>
    <li>If the entered number is less than a random number which the program has generated, you should to display the text: <code>Your number is too small. Please, try again.</code>. If the entered number is more than the number which the program has generated, you should display the text: <code>Your number is too big. Please, try again.</code>.</li>
    <li>If the entered number is equal to the number which the program has generated, it is necessary to display the text on the screen: <code>Congratulations, {name}!</code>.</li>
    <li>The task must be performed using arrays (<strong>DO NOT USE THE INTERFACES</strong> <code>List</code>, <code>Set</code>, <code>Map</code>).</li>
