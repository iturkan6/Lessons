Create Spring Boot Application with a right structure
Define port 8000

Create Entities : Seller and Goods(apples, oranges, bananas)
Every entity must have id field.
Goods will have standard fields (id, price, amount)

Create for each entity create CRUD methods.
All endpoints must return ResponseEntity object.

Create endpoint:
        /getFruits - which will take as a request parameter type of fruit and redirect to endpoint which will show
        all fruits of defining type.

Create tests for all endpoints in postman.

Good luck! :)
