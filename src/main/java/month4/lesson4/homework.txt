Create Spring Boot project:
1) Project must be with a right structure
2) Define port 8000
3) You have a car shop, there are different type of cars (volvo, bmw, mercedes)
4) Each car have regNumber, color, engineType and mileage

For each car you must define CRUD endpoint via DAO structure (think about how you can less code for entities if each
car have same characteristics)

For each you must define endpoint: (use HTTP methods):
    a) /create - this endpoint must create new car
    b) /get/{regNumber} - this endpoint must return car with right regNumber
    c) /update/{regNumber) - this endpoint update car
    d) /delete/{regNumber} - this endpoint delete car

    Create endpoints in POSTMAN for testing
