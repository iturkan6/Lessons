Create simple spring boot application
Define port 8081

Create countries entity (Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey) with fields - id, city, population
Create CRUD methods

Create custom exceptions for cases - city with defined id not found, user nor created
Create endpoint (/default) which will return HTML with sorry message and status 500

Create endpoint /getCities - which will take as a request parameter name of country and redirect to endpoint which will show
                        all cities of defining country (use RedirectView);


Good luck! :)
