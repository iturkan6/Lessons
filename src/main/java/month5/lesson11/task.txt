Create standard Spring Boot application
Define port 9000

Create 2 entities: Wife and Husband
Each will have: name, surname which can not be null and passport number which must be unique
And years.

Fill yaml file
Connect to db
Create new schema
Create tables for each entity and relational table in new schema

Create and implement CRUD methods by using JPA repo


Create custom exceptions No...EntityException and ...EntityNotCreated
Throw to custom exceptions where it needs

Create record class for creating entity only with id of relational table
Create endpoint for creating entity only with id of relational entity - /withId

POST endpoint must be already common

Good luck!
