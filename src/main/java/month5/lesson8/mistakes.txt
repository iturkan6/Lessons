Problems with oneToOne relations:
    1. How must look JSON?
        Example:
                {
                    "name": "Test",
                    "surname": "test",
                    "document": {
                        "doc_name": "name",
                        "doc_number": "number"
                    }
                }
                We create userr object with oneToOne relation to document object

    2. Why when I create object via postman it creates entity with all fields null?
        Check annotations, could be you forgotten some of them f.e. @RequestBody

    3. Why in a process of creating new entity it shows me
    "object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing"
    exception?
        It was the fact that the Child object I was adding to the Parent wasn't saved in the database yet.
        So when I added the Child to the Parent, then saved the Parent, Hibernate would toss the
        "object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing"
        message when saving the Parent.

        Adding in the cascade = {CascadeType.ALL} on the Parent's reference to the Child solved the problem in both cases.
        This saved the Child and the Parent.

    4. What if I want to create new schema for each project?
    For this you need create new schema in DataGrip and add configuration in properties or YAML file:
        properties:
          hibernate:
            default_schema: new_db

            In default_schema you write name of your schema and you table will be created there.
