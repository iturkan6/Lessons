Create Spring Boot application

Create 2 entities:
Applicant and Interviewer
Both entities must have fields (boolean: answer from applicant/interviewer)

Create relation manyToMany
Connect to db
Create and implement CRUD methods

Create Record Classes for request and response

In getById endpoint implement logic:
Only if answer from applicant/interviewer true it must return entity

Good luck!
